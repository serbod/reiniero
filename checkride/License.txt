CheckRide licenses
==================
Just wanted to make sure you understand and accept under what licenses the various CheckRide components are distributed.
If you don't agree with those licenses, please don't use the product.
The non-lawyer summary: you may use these programs, even commercially, but please don't sue anybody and you may have to distribute source code to stuff if you modify it.
See below for details.

1. Description
==============
The CheckRide package contains of some wrapper and helper programs (e.g. CheckRide, CheckRideHelper, CheckRideResourceZipper) that use the UltraVNC, and stunnel programs and associated libraries (DLLS) and configuration files.
The wrapper and helper programs don't link (statically or dynamically) to these applications/DLLs, but execute them and use command-line parameters and configuration files to specify what to do.

2. CheckRide, CheckRideHelper, CheckRideResourceZipper License
==============================================================
The CheckRide, CheckRideHelper and CheckRideResourceZipper source code/programs are released as freeware under the MIT license: all use permitted but no liability accepted:

the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with
this program; if not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses>.

Linking stunnel statically or dynamically with other modules is making
a combined work based on stunnel. Thus, the terms and conditions of the
GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holder of stunnel gives you
permission to combine stunnel with free software programs or libraries that
are released under the GNU LGPL and with code included in the standard release
of OpenSSL under the OpenSSL License (or modified versions of such code, with
unchanged license). You may copy and distribute such a system following the
terms of the GNU GPL for stunnel and the licenses of the other code concerned.

Note that people who make modified versions of stunnel are not obligated to
grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is their choice
whether to do so. The GNU General Public License gives permission to release
a modified version without this exception; this exception also makes it
possible to release a modified version which carries forward this exception.
